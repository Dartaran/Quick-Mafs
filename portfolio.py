'''
File:
    portfolio.py

Description:
    Extend this interface with a class that provides for a portfolio
    allocation strategy. See sample_strategy.py for an example. Your
    strategy will be tested with a hidden test dataset that will be
    included as 'ticker_data.csv' and 'stock_data.csv 'in the same
    stock_data/ directory included in the repository. It is highly
    recommended that you study the documentation of the pandas libary.

Notes:
    - Do NOT make any modifications to this file; when testing your
    implementation, we will use the original version of this file if any
    modifications were made.
    - You are required to implement (override) the build_signal function
    after extending this interface. Attempting to override any other method
    in this class will lead to immediate disqualification from the round.

Questions:
    Please contact jigar@uchicago.edu or vtalasani@uchicago.edu
